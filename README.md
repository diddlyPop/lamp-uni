"use cs332aXX". Use "source createTables.sql; source insertData.sql;" in mariadb console to create db and fill with data.
If need to reset db, use "drop table x;" where x is the current table you want to drop, createTables.sql does not drop in the correct order due to FK restraints. You can also drop the whole database and recreate it: "drop database x" and "create database x"
